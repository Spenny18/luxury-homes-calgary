            Spencer grew up on Calgary's west side, watching the city's luxury
            tier evolve from a handful of estate streets into the most
            interesting real estate market in Western Canada. He started his
            practice in 2012 representing entry-level buyers in inner-city
            Calgary — and within four years was working exclusively in homes
            above the million-dollar mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            That progression shaped how he runs his business today. Spencer
            still treats every listing the way he treated his first one — with
            the photographer who actually shoots architecture for magazines, a
            stager who understands what families in Aspen Woods actually want,
            and an offer strategy built on absorption data rather than wishful
            thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the buying side, Spencer's network includes builders, estate
            attorneys, and divorce mediators across Calgary's prestige
            communities. A meaningful portion of his closings every year come
            from properties that never appear on the public MLS — homes that
            change hands through introductions Spencer has spent a decade
            earning.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he isn't showing properties, Spencer is at the Glencoe Club,
            on the bow with his kids, or somewhere in the foothills with his
            wife and the family golden. Calgary is home, and he intends to be
            here doing this for the next twenty years.
