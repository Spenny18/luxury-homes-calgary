      "Upper Mount Royal sits on the high ground south of 17th Avenue, plotted at the start of the 20th century when the railway barons wanted a neighbourhood that looked over the city instead of into it. A century of careful zoning has preserved the original lot widths — 50 to 100 feet — which means the streetscape still feels generous in a city that increasingly does not.",
      "The architecture reads as a quiet anthology: surviving Edwardians on Prospect, restrained Tudors on Hope and Talon, and a thin layer of contemporary infill where the original homes could not be saved. Replacement value runs higher here than anywhere else in Calgary, and the inventory is correspondingly thin — most years see fewer than thirty arm's-length sales.",

Lot widths matter more here than in any other Calgary neighbourhood — a 75-foot lot on Prospect prices roughly 60% above an equivalent 50-foot lot one street over.",
