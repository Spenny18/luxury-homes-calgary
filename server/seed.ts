      "Days-on-market for homes that did list publicly averaged 41 days, down from 67 in Q1 2025. The cleanest, best-priced homes are still moving in under 30; the long sits are almost always a pricing problem rather than a market problem.",
      "Inventory is the single biggest constraint right now. Active listings over $2M sit at 84 across all of Calgary as of April 1 — that's roughly 4.6 months of supply at current absorption. Anything under 6 months is a seller's market.",
      "My read: pricing power continues to favour sellers in the $2-4M range, and the off-market trend will keep accelerating in the prestige communities. If you're considering selling in 2026, the conversation about strategy should start three to six months ahead.",

A 75-foot lot on Prospect prices roughly 60% above an equivalent 50-foot lot one street over, even if the homes are similar. When you tour, count the steps from one side of the lot line to the other — if you can pace it in fewer than 25 steps, it's a 50-foot lot.",

    body: [
      "At the high end of the market, pricing is the entire game. The first 21 days of a listing generate 80% of the qualified showings; what happens after that is largely a function of the price you set on day one.",
      "No one pays full price for a stale donut. A home that sits without offers for 60 days carries a perceptual penalty that no amount of staging or photography will erase. The market reads the days-on-market field.",
      "My approach: I price every luxury listing within 3% of the supportable comparable range. That gives the first wave of buyers a sense that the home is fairly priced, and it gives me room to negotiate without erasing the seller's position.",
      "The temptation to test the market with an aspirational price is real, and I understand it. But every week the home sits over its supportable price, the eventual sale price erodes by roughly 0.5%. Eight weeks of testing typically costs more than the would-be upside.",
      "The right price isn't the highest price. It's the price that gets the home in front of every qualified buyer in the first 21 days, and lets the strongest of them compete.",

    body: [
      "Off-market activity at the top of the Calgary market has roughly doubled since 2023. In Q1 2026, nine of the 18 sales over $2M closed without a public MLS listing.",
      "There are three drivers. First, sellers in prestige communities increasingly value privacy — they don't want photos of their interior on a public website. Second, the agent networks have professionalized: a small group of agents now share off-market inventory in structured ways. Third, qualified buyers in this segment have learned to ask for inventory that isn't yet listed.",
      "For sellers, off-market can be a strong strategy when the home has a defined buyer profile and a flexible timeline. It's a weak strategy when the seller needs broad market exposure — you trade reach for privacy.",
      "For buyers, the implication is straightforward: if you're shopping over $2M, the public listings are not the full market. Working with an agent who is plugged into the off-market network changes the inventory you see by 30-50%.",
      "This trend is not going to reverse. Expect the share of off-market sales to keep climbing through the rest of 2026.",

    excerpt:
      "When does it make sense to restore a heritage home, and when is the better play to rebuild? A frank look at the math.",
    body: [
      "The most common question I field on inner-city luxury homes: do I restore the existing house, or tear it down and build new? The answer depends on three numbers.",
      "First, the lot value. In Upper Mount Royal, a finished 60-foot lot is worth $1.6-2.1M as land. If the home on it adds less than 60% to that — meaning the total list is under $3.4M for a 60-foot lot — you're effectively pricing it as a teardown anyway.",
      "Second, the cost to renovate. A meaningful renovation of a 1920s heritage home runs $400-600/sqft on the floor area touched. New construction in the same neighbourhood is closer to $700-900/sqft all-in. The renovation looks cheaper per foot, but the deferred maintenance — knob-and-tube wiring, lath-and-plaster walls, undersized ductwork — adds 20-30% in scope by the time you finish.",
      "Third, the heritage covenant. If the home is formally protected, the rebuild option is partially or fully off the table. That changes the math entirely — you're committed to a restoration, and the lot's price needs to reflect that constraint.",
      "My rule of thumb: if the existing home was built before 1950 and has architectural integrity, restoration almost always wins on resale. If it's a 1960s or 70s box on a great lot, the rebuild is the play. The middle case — a 1980s or 90s home on a strong lot — is the hardest call, and depends on the specific home.",

    body: [
      "Aspen Woods and Springbank Hill share a lot — both built between 2000 and 2018, both west of Sarcee Trail, both feeding into the same Webber/Rundle/Calgary Academy private school cluster. But they price differently for a reason.",
      "Aspen has the demographic concentration. School cohort matters here — families pay a premium to be in the catchment that puts their kids on the same bus as the neighbour's kids. The community has a tighter social fabric and a more uniform housing standard.",
      "Springbank Hill has the lots. The older sections, built in the late 1990s, sit on 0.18-0.35 acre lots that you simply cannot find in Aspen. If you want acreage feel inside city limits, Springbank delivers it. The trade-off is a 5-10 minute longer commute and a slightly looser housing standard — not every block is uniformly upscale.",
      "Resale: Aspen homes hold value in normal markets and outperform in downturns. Springbank Hill homes hold value in normal markets and slightly underperform in downturns, but offer more upside in tight markets when the inventory advantage matters.",
      "My read: if you're a family with two or three school-age kids and a five-to-ten year horizon, Aspen is the safer play. If you have a longer horizon, want a bigger lot, or have already aged past the school-age window, Springbank Hill is often the better dollar.",
